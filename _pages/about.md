<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D. student at the School of Computer and Artificial Intelligence, **Zhengzhou University (郑州大学)**. I am fortunately advised by **Prof. Mingliang Xu (徐明亮)** and **Prof. Shupan Li (李书攀)**. Concurrently, I am privileged to receive remote academic guidance from **Prof. Muhammad Haris Khan** at the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI). 

Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained my Master's degree in Computer Science and Technology from **Northwest University (西北大学)** in 2024, where I was supervised by **Prof. Jun Feng (冯筠)**. I received my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from **Henan University (河南大学)** in 2021.

My research interests primarily focus on **Transfer Learning** (specifically Domain Generalization), **Multimodal Learning**, and **Continual Learning**.
